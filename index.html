<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  We started off working with Bezier curves and linearly interpolating control points to evaluate curves via de Casteljau's algorithm; then, we extended this to Bezier surfaces with a similar intuition recursing from 3D. For the second part of the assignment, we worked with the triangle meshes data structure to manipulate mesh topology (splitting and flipping edges). In the last task, we implemented loop subdivision to upsample the mesh, allowing us to further manipulate the mesh topology. Throughout the assignment, we've learned how to model smooth and scalable objects and solidified how triangle meshes are a fundamental part of 3D modeling and computer graphics.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  For each pair of sequential control points, we linearly interpolate, with the given parameter t. Effectively, this decrements the number of points by one each step, 
  so we recursively subdivide until we end up with one point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  The intuition behind our implementation for evaluating Bezier surfaces stems from the implementation of de Casteljau for Bezier curves. To extend from Bezier curves to surfaces, we perform a series of separable 1D operations.
  For the Bezier surface, we have a 2D (nxn) grid of control points, so we reduce from Bezier surface to curve by taking each row of control points and performing de casteljau on t=u (given parameter). We will then accumulate a point for each row and so then, we again perform de casteljau for these points treating it as a single row on t = v (the given parameter). This last operation of de casteljau will then result in an evaluated point on (u,v) on the bezier surface.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  We traverse the different faces of the triangles connected to this vertex starting at the halfedge. We get the vertex of this halfedge, then move
  to the next half edge using halfedge->next(). Again, we get the vertex associated with this half edge and move to the next half edge, where we can 
  get the final vertex. Once all vertices are found, we can calculate the cross product and add this to our running cross product sum. By adding the
  cross product, we do not need to weigh the norm by the area, and can simply add all the cross products together. We then traverse to the next halfedge 
  and repeat this process until all cross products have been summed together. Finally, we normalize this running sum to return our final answer.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented the edge flip operation by manually reassigning each pointer for each half edge associated with the edge flip. Given the half edge,
    we used a series of calls to get the next halfedge, twin halfedge, vertice, and edge for each relevant halfedge to create a "picture" of half edges, similar to the given example picture. Once
    we had all the relevant half edges for the operation, we reassigned the pointers each half edge had to match the newly flipped image. This was pretty
    confusing to wrap our head around, and it helped a lot to have a picture in real life to visualize the process. 
    The <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">linked pdf</a> from the spec helped us a lot with this. 
    Once we could actually visualize how
    the newly flipped image looked with all halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces labeled, we could easily just reassign these values for each halfedge to
    match the new orientation. This can be seen in our implementation, as we used 87 lines to change all the pointers manually, without the use of for loops.
    We also made sure to check if either face was a boundary before performing the flip operation, as we cannot flip on boundaries.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
  The only problem we ran into was incorrectly setting pointers. We had the correct idea from the visual and our own understanding, but small mistakes 
  ended up costing us time because of how many lines were required to implement everything correctly. 
  When it came to debugging, our strategy again was to use the visual from earlier.
  This allowed us to check to make sure that each object had its pointers reassigned correctly. 
  Using a before and after image helped us understand what we were doing much more intuitively, so once we correctly reassigned all pointers our
  function worked intendedly.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Our approach was very similar to task 4. We again used a before and after image for what the new relationships would be for the halfedges, edges, vertices, and faces.
    However before we could reassign pointers, we had to create the newly required halfedges, edges, faces, and vertex. Then we could use the before and after image we made
    to successfully reassign the pointers for our halfedges, faces, vertices, and edges. Once everything was properly set, our edge split function worked properly.
    We again used the before image from <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">this pdf</a>, along with our own
    after image. Below is the before/after image we used to approach this problem.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Debugging for this part was more about correctly implementing our solution. It took many lines of code to manually create the relevant objects and reassign pointers.
    One problem we ran into is that new edges, halfedges, vertices, and faces need to have all their pointers set immedietely before trying to work with other objects. When we did not
    do this, we ran into a segfault. To solve this, for some of our objects we had to assign tempory pointers, as the correct pointer for a certain halfedge/edge/etc may not have been
    initialized yet. After everything was initialized, we could reassign these temporary pointers before moving on to reassigning the pointers for the rest of the objects. Again,
    relying on the visuals we had and double checking everything was very helpful in our debugging process.
</p>
<br>


<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  The initial step of our implementation was to compute the positions of both the new and old vertices; we perform this step before subdividing so that it's easier to traverse the entire mesh.
  For each new vertex, we compute the new position by weighting the sum of the four connected vertices (one opposing pair is multiplied by 3/8 and the other 1/8). Then we update the new position of the old vertex by (1-n*u) * original_position + (u * original_neighbor_position_sum), where n is the degree
  of the vertex, u is 3/16 if n==3 else 3/8n, and original_neighbor_position_sum is the sum of positions of its neighbouring vertices. Once we compute all the new positions, we split all the current edges and for each edge that's connected to a new and old vertex, we will flip these edges. Finally, we update the original positions of all vertices to its new positions.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
  In the comparisons below, each level of subdivision makes the object appear smoother and more refined; the sharp corners and edges are flattened . If we don't want as strong of an effect (not such a flattened mesh), we can pre-split the edges to create a more detailed effect, since pre-splitting will inherently change the mesh (adding more edges and vertices).

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several
  
  iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  We can make the cube subdivide more symmetrically by preprocessing (splitting the edge of each face of the cube). This achieves a more balanced connectivity of the mesh (more vertices and edges distributed evenly). Essentially, the intuition behind this is that by having a stronger uniform foundation initially, the latter subdivisions will follow this topology. If we had an extremely uneven topology, the subdivisions will strengthen this structure. So by preprocessing, adding splits and flips initially, we build a more symmetrical, balanced structure that will then be symmetrically connected as we increase the amount of subdivisions.
